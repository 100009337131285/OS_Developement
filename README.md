## Welcome to OS Developement!
My plan for this is to write an operating system completely from scratch.  While I could use GRUB as my bootloader, I am writing my own bootloader that goes through the necessary measures to get into long mode and load the kernel.  The kernel is completely up in the air.  Since this is a new learning experience for me, I am unsure how far I want to take the kernel.
